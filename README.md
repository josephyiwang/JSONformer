This is a coding challenge solution written by Joseph Wang.

## Execution

- I've written a Golang parse file function for the coding challenge.
- To use this class, invoke the 'ParseFileToJSON()' method with the path of the file you intend to transform. The program will then output the transformed JSON to stdout. 
- This is demonstrated in the main method of the main.go file.
- The example input is provided.
- This is a full solution that includes all requested data type transformations.
